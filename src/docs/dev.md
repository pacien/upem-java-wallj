# Preamble

"Wall-J: the Space Cleaner" is a game in which a player uses bombs to push garbage into trash cans in user definable
worlds.

Being part of the "OOP with Java" course at [UPEM](http://www.u-pem.fr/), this application has been entirely
written in Java and makes use of the Zen5 and [JBox2D](http://www.jbox2d.org/) libraries.
